## 🎯 Why Use This Tool?

This tool is designed for **curious investors** who want to explore beyond passive index investing without the complexity and competition of day trading.

### The Investment Sweet Spot

**Not for day trading** 📉
Individual traders can't compete with hedge funds, HFT algorithms, and institutional systems operating at millisecond speeds. Day trading is a zero-sum game dominated by professionals with superior technology and information.

**Not for passive index investing** 📊
If you're content with market returns through index funds (S&P 500, total market ETFs), that's excellent - but you don't need screening tools. Just buy and hold.

**Perfect for systematic, research-driven investing** 🔍
This tool is for investors who:
- Want to **explore higher alpha strategies** than passive investing
- Are **curious to learn** different investment approaches (value, growth, quality, momentum)
- Seek **better risk-adjusted returns** through systematic stock selection
- Prefer **multi-month to multi-year investment horizons** without intraday stress
- Want to **test investment hypotheses** using fundamental and technical data
- Value **systematic screening** over gut feelings and tips

### Your Edge: Time, Research, and Patience

Unlike hedge funds competing on speed and information access, you can compete on:
- **Patience** - Hold positions through volatility without quarterly reporting pressure
- **Research depth** - Screen comprehensively with 75+ fundamental and technical fields
- **Strategy experimentation** - Test different approaches (quality, value, growth, momentum)
- **Risk management** - Build diversified portfolios with systematic criteria

**This tool helps you find opportunities, understand metrics, and make informed decisions - not chase minute-by-minute price movements.**

## Investment Focus & Limitations

This tool is designed for **research and position selection**, not intraday trading:

- **Current fundamentals snapshot** - Latest quarterly/annual data for investment decisions (no tick-by-tick historical data needed)
- **Research-paced rate limits** - Conservative default (10 req/min) supports thorough analysis, not high-frequency trading
- **Strategic timeframes** - Daily/weekly data updates align with multi-month investment horizons
- **Fundamental-first approach** - Emphasizes financial metrics over intraday price action

**By design**, this tool doesn't support:
- Real-time tick data or intraday charts (not needed for position investing)
- High-frequency screening (research takes time and thought)
- Options chains or derivatives (focused on equity fundamentals)
- News feeds or sentiment analysis (focus on numbers and metrics)
