**What it does:**
1. Lists all available preset strategies (quality, value, dividend, momentum, growth, etc.)
2. Asks you to select a strategy interactively
3. Runs the screener with the chosen preset
4. Displays summary table of top results
5. Saves complete results to CSV file with timestamp

**When to use:**
- Building watchlists for different investment styles
- Learning what different strategies find
- Comparing results across multiple time periods
- Generating ideas for further research

**Output location:**
- CSV files saved to: `docs/local/screening-runs/`
- Filename format: `{preset_name}_{YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS}.csv`

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Run the command
/run-screener

# 2. Select strategy (e.g., "Quality Stocks")

# 3. Review summary table:
#    - Top 10 results shown with key metrics
#    - Total count of matches

## Usage Tips

### First-time setup

After cloning the repository:

```bash
# Quick setup script (recommended)
./local-setup.sh          # Linux/Mac
local-setup.bat           # Windows

# Or manually:
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
cp .claude/settings.json.example .claude/settings.local.json

# Restart Claude Code
```

### Development mode

For active development on the MCP server:

```bash
# Modify .mcp.json to use local source:
# "args": ["tsx", "src/index.ts"]  # Instead of npx tradingview-mcp-server
```

This runs TypeScript source directly without building, enabling faster iteration.

## Creating Custom Commands

Custom commands are markdown files in this directory with frontmatter:

# Command Title

Detailed instructions for Claude Code to execute...
```

**Tips for writing commands:**
1. Be specific and actionable - commands are instructions, not documentation
2. Reference MCP tools explicitly (e.g., `mcp__tradingview__screen_stocks`)
3. Include example responses or table formats
4. Handle edge cases (0 results, errors)
5. Provide clear success criteria

See the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) for more details on custom commands.

## MCP Tools Used

These commands leverage the following TradingView MCP tools:

- `mcp__tradingview__lookup_symbols` - Direct symbol lookup (indexes, stocks)
- `mcp__tradingview__screen_stocks` - Stock screening with filters
- `mcp__tradingview__get_preset` - Fetch pre-configured strategies
- `mcp__tradingview__list_presets` - List all available presets

For complete MCP tool documentation, see the main [README.md](../../README.md).

## Output Directory

The `docs/local/` directory (gitignored) is used for command outputs:

```
docs/local/
â””â”€â”€ screening-runs/     # CSV outputs from /run-screener
    â”œâ”€â”€ quality_stocks_2025-10-28_22-30-45.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ value_stocks_2025-10-28_22-35-12.csv
    â””â”€â”€ market_indexes_2025-10-28_22-40-33.csv
```

This keeps your analysis organized and prevents clutter in the main repository.
